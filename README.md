# Calculator
This is a calculator written in Java.

It creates a window with buttons that you can use to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can also the buttons to input numbers and decimals, clear the calculator, delete digits, and change the sign of a number. When you press the equals button, it performs the calculation and displays the result.

There are limiations for example to this code. For example, this simple calulator can only take two variables at a time.
If were to input 5 + 5 + 3, the calculator would only return 8 as the result. It will drop stored values and replace them with new ones. So if a member would like to input more than two values they would have to input the first two select enter and then input the third.

Another limitations is that you can not type in the equations you would like the caculator to solve.

I am currently look into a 'fix' for this. :D
